# React + Tailwind Task Manager

## Task Manager Project
### This Task Manager project features a modal with a form that opens when the "Add" button is clicked. In this form, you can specify the task's text and set a deadline date. In the notes section, the background color of the notes changes once the deadline passes or on the day of the deadline itself.

### The project also includes inline editing capabilities, allowing you to modify both the text and the deadline directly. Additionally, you can easily delete notes or rearrange them using the drag-and-drop functionality.
